NAME
    Serabi - Create REST-style web service with Riap backend

VERSION
    version 0.00

DESCRIPTION
    This will be a set of PSGI middlewares (Plack::Middleware::Serabi::*) to
    help you build REST-style web service with Riap backend. This is meant
    as an alternative (or companion) to Periuk (a.k.a.
    Perinci::Access::HTTP::Server).

    I currently have no plan implementing this, as I find Rinci/Riap easy to
    implement and sufficient for a rich and usable API service. But this
    library is mostly only about mapping HTTP requests (URI's, methods,
    headers) as REST resources and verbs, and then mapping them to Riap
    requests.

STATUS
    Nothing is implemented yet.

FAQ
  Serabi?
    Serabi is a delicious traditional food from where I live (Java,
    Indonesia). I picked the name after a Python project, jango-tastypie.
    Aside from the name, both projects are unrelated.
